# üß† Text Summarization & Classification with Transformers

This project demonstrates the use of a pre-trained transformer model for text summarization and classification using the Hugging Face `transformers` library. Built in Google Colab.

## üîß Features

- üìÑ Summarizes long texts into concise summaries
- üè∑Ô∏è Classifies input text into broad categories
- üîç Based on pretrained models like BART or T5

## üöÄ How to Use

Just open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and run the cells.

## üíæ Requirements

```bash
pip install transformers sentencepiece

## üìå Demo Output

**Example input:**

> Soft robotics integrates compliant materials and innovative design principles...

**Summarized:**

> Soft robotics uses soft materials and new design methods for adaptable robots.
